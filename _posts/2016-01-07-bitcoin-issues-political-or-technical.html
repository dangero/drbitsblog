<i>"The problem is that bitcoin has succeeded technically and is midway through the process of failing politically."</i><br />-Vinay Gupta<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" class="YOUTUBE-iframe-video" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FHFSvttMg6E/0.jpg" frameborder="0" height="240" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FHFSvttMg6E?feature=player_embedded" width="426"></iframe></div><br /><br />There are many aspects of bitcoin that this quote could be in reference to, but for the sake of conversation I think it is important to point out that the community currently has no centralized location for discussion. What we have is a variety of separated mediums used by the community to communicate from bitcointalk forums, to reddit, to developer mailing lists, and IRC. The inherent problem is that bitcoin is decentralized, so how can the community cooperate without centralized communication mediums? These mediums can be censored and anyone who spent time on Reddit in 2015, where the largest group of Bitcoin users meet, can feel the confusion in the community over things like the blocksize debate.<br /><i><br /></i><i>"Until the bitcoin community admits that it's got political problems rather than technical problems, they're trapped."</i><br />-Vinay Gupta<br /><br />Taking a step back from the tough technical decisions the community needs to make, perhaps we should reflect on this quote. Do we really have technical problems? Yes and no. We do, but relative to the political issues they do not seem very serious because we seem to find solutions for the issues that come up. Bitcoin technically is getting better over time. On the other hand, do there seem to be political problems? Absolutely! Everything from community splintering to, forum censorship, to general user confusion, to inability to poll the community; these are issues that generally grow larger as the size of a community grows. There is a lot that needs to improve on the political front and as Vinay points out these aren't problems specific to bitcoin or cryptocurrencies. We should look at how people have solved these issues in the past for guidance or we may fail.<br /><br />
