The most common questions I get about bitcoin relate to its value. Why is a bitcoin worth anything? There are several factors that when combined make bitcoin valuable. One of those is that bitcoins are scarce. How can a digital asset be scarce? Large music companies sued Napster into oblivion because Napster allowed people to easily share digital copies of music. Since a computer can copy data at nearly no intrinsic cost, music companies lost the ability to control music distribution when mp3s appeared on the scene.<br /><div><br /></div><div>Bitcoins cannot be copied like mp3 files. In fact <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_supply#Currency_with_Finite_Supply">there is currently around 13 million bitcoins and there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins</a>. This is possible through the decentralized ledger. Since all network participant nodes keep a full history showing all account balances and transactions, each node can therefore verify that no extra bitcoins have been created.&nbsp;</div>
