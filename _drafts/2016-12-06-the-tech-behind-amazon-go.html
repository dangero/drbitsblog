<h2 style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Amazon just announced Amazon Go, so I'm taking a look at the tech that is most likely behind it based on what we have seen and heard thus far.</h2><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" class="YOUTUBE-iframe-video" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NrmMk1Myrxc/0.jpg" frameborder="0" height="385" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NrmMk1Myrxc?feature=player_embedded" width="640"></iframe></div><br />First of all, let's take a discerning look at some of the information that Amazon has provided:<br /><br /><h3>1. Subway-like app scanning turnstiles at entrance</h3><br />This is where Amazon captures your identity and links it to your credit card which was setup prior.&nbsp;Notice in the short clip below you can see what appears to be a transparent gate blocking her path before she scans the phone. It seems to indicate they will literally stop you from coming in until they know who you are.&nbsp;It's also significant to note that Amazon says this is a store without lines, but the entrance is gated, so you could very easily see a line at the entrance instead of the exit. Granted, this line should move faster than a grocery checkout, but Amazon can also use the turnstiles to limit the maximum capacity of the store. It's likely that their automated software system will not function if the customer density is too high. More on this later.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yI6bkwM2fFk/WEcKGkerMkI/AAAAAAAAAKc/vXWePlNrAN0tG_trO4BraYf1G-aT1rW0ACLcB/s1600/amazongoentrance.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yI6bkwM2fFk/WEcKGkerMkI/AAAAAAAAAKc/vXWePlNrAN0tG_trO4BraYf1G-aT1rW0ACLcB/s640/amazongoentrance.gif" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><h3 style="clear: both; text-align: left;">2. Human staff managing the store, baking bread, etc</h3><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">This is significant because the announcement could have just as easily been a completely robotic store with no staff on the floor. The human element also gives them a great fallback. Since right now they are opening a single store, they can closely monitor the software and refine it with humans present to resolve any bugs that may occur. It also guards against theft and helps new customers learn how to use the store.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Rr80ktIpjos/WEcLhR8yJqI/AAAAAAAAAKk/g5KF4P7GlLkysMauRnE97jPSqvJHyvqmACLcB/s1600/amazonstaff.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Rr80ktIpjos/WEcLhR8yJqI/AAAAAAAAAKk/g5KF4P7GlLkysMauRnE97jPSqvJHyvqmACLcB/s640/amazonstaff.gif" width="640" /></a></div><h3 style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br />3. Sensors galore to detect customer activities</h3><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Notice the transparent separators between each distinct item on the shelf. This could indicate several different known approaches to detecting when an item leaves or returns to the shelf. The basic concept is that if the system knows what is located in a particular row, then all that is left to do is detect when the item is removed or added.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BRinp0FwZL4/WEcNq8qxdDI/AAAAAAAAAK0/ygatFcADiJI3nzRmY3IqqfQkdAoUkwtPACLcB/s1600/bottle-grab-desktop._V523327232_.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="426" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BRinp0FwZL4/WEcNq8qxdDI/AAAAAAAAAK0/ygatFcADiJI3nzRmY3IqqfQkdAoUkwtPACLcB/s640/bottle-grab-desktop._V523327232_.png" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><h3 style="clear: both; text-align: left;">4. Small grocery store footprint</h3><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><i><br /></i></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><i>"Our roughly 1,800 square feet of retail space is conveniently compact so busy customers can get in and out fast."</i></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Compare that to the average grocery store square footage which runs <a href="http://time.com/money/136330/why-your-grocery-store-may-soon-be-cut-in-half/">an average of 35,000 square feet</a>, the Amazon alternative can be more likened to something half the size of the <a href="http://supermarketnews.com/retail_financial/fresh_easy_express_1104">now defunct Fresh and Easy Express stores. Those ran around 3,000 square feet.</a>&nbsp;So it's very tiny which lends itself well to sensor technology. This means it's likely that every single inch of this store is covered by the various sensors they are using.</div><h3 style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br />5. No check-out required</h3><br />You can just leave once you've collected the items you want to buy. They are automatically charged to your credit card on file. This means that Amazon knows what you picked up in the store at the time that you picked it up and it can also detect when you left the store. Remember you did that extra step when you walked in of identifying yourself, so in one way they partially moved the checkout process to the entrance instead of the exit, but removed the per item scanning that currently exists at all major grocery stores and takes the most time.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lMe3O3bfNoI/WEcgTRG6aBI/AAAAAAAAALI/P-_CnECTLzAGLyS7VIsU6ZVnrIvywH1cgCLcB/s1600/justwalkout.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lMe3O3bfNoI/WEcgTRG6aBI/AAAAAAAAALI/P-_CnECTLzAGLyS7VIsU6ZVnrIvywH1cgCLcB/s640/justwalkout.gif" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><h2 style="clear: both; text-align: left;">The Tech Breakdown</h2><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">And now we can take a look at how they might be applying tech. First of all, there's a lot of innovation here in the way they are combining key technologies together, but I do not believe they are building anything mysterious or wholly new. In other words I think most all of this can be built with off the shelf parts and open source tools. First of all, let's take a look at the store layout with a quick diagram I threw together:</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><br /><br />
