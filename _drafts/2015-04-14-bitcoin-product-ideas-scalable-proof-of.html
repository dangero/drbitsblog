Proof of Existence is a concept that originated long before Bitcoin, but the invention of the blockchain created an efficient method to implement a solution. Here's a quick description of how Proof of Existence works:<div><br /></div><div>SHA256 is an example of an irreversible hash function which is also sometimes called a trapped door function. What this means is that if you take a sequence of bytes and feed it into the SHA256 algorithm, you get out 256 bits. These 256 bits are the SHA256 hash of the bytes you fed in. Here's the significance: You will always get the same 256 bits when you feed in that original sequence of bytes, but if you give someone those 256 bits they will have no way of reversing the algorithm to get the original source bytes again. Also, those 256 bits have enough precision and randomness that there has never been a single collision between two SHA256 hashes on earth.</div><div><br /></div><div>What does this have to do with proving a document or file existed? Let's use an example of a pdf document. Assume the pdf is the sequence of bytes that are fed into SHA256 in order to produce this 256 bit hash. Suppose the pdf contained an invention you created and you wanted to be able prove in 10 years that you had already created this particular pdf file. You could take that 256 bit hash, write it down on several pieces of paper and mail it to many people with a note to say they should keep the postmarked envelope and number series inside. 10 years go by, you contact the people who you mailed letters to you and ask them to produce the envelope and letter and also to testify of when it was received.&nbsp;</div>
