<div style="color: #363636; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 24px;">A recent quote from Bill Gates (<a data-mce-href="http://video.foxbusiness.com/v/2359385547001/Â " href="http://video.foxbusiness.com/v/2359385547001/%C2%A0" style="color: #743399; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5em;">source</a>) seemed like the perfect title for my first post about Bitcoin. I first heard about Bitcoin in 2011, but it took a couple of years for me to grasp its importance. In 2013 I started to study Bitcoin and develop with the technology. In this post I plan to explain the reasons why Bitcoin is significant.</div><h3 style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 30px; letter-spacing: -0.5px; line-height: 1.5em; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Open Source Technology</h3><div style="color: #363636; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 24px;">"Bitcoin" is nothing more than a pile of computer source code. That code is all open source. What does that mean? It means you can read the code yourself and you can modify it yourself. (<a data-mce-href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin" href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin" style="color: #743399; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5em;">link to source</a>) Bitcoin purports to be a secure system for money storage and transfer. We can trust it because we can read the code ourselves and see how it works. If you personally cannot understand the code, you can trust any number of qualified people who have read the code including myself who will tell you that the architecture is sound. If Bitcoin were closed source we could not easily know how it works and it would be extremely difficult to know how secure it is. Furthermore, since the code is available, Bitcoin can and is evolving. What that means is that even if there are inevitably bugs in the Bitcoin code, those issues can be resolved over time. Bitcoin can also be modified in the future to be better than it is today. For example, changes could be put in to make Bitcoin transactions happen faster, or allow the protocol to handle more transactions per second than it currently does.</div><h3 style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 30px; letter-spacing: -0.5px; line-height: 1.5em; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Open Ledger</h3><div style="color: #363636; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 24px;">The Blockchain is a public ledger that Bitcoin generates. This ledger is what holds the balance of every account and shows the movement of money from one account to another. This information is completely public. I think that fact is worth repeating. All transactions and all account balances in Bitcoin are public. In fact a number of websites allow you to easily browse that data (<a data-mce-href="https://blockchain.info/" href="https://blockchain.info/" style="color: #743399; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5em;">ex:&nbsp;https://blockchain.info</a>). The public ledger is significant because again it shows that the system works in a public fashion. There are no secret transactions. When you send money to someone on the Bitcoin network, you can see they received it on their end.</div><h3 style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 30px; letter-spacing: -0.5px; line-height: 1.5em; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Secure Money Storage and Transactions</h3><div style="color: #363636; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 24px;">Every couple of years my credit card number gets stolen and I have to deal with canceling my card, getting a new one, and then reconfiguring my auto withdrawals, etc. Bitcoin accounts cannot be stolen in this way. Credit cards were invented before modern cryptography and so they could not take advantage of many of the advances we have now. The credit card number you supply when buying things is the very information that a thief needs to steal money from your account. Bitcoin uses a technology called public/private cryptography to avoid this. Public/private keys&nbsp;allow a person to pay for something in Bitcoin without ever needing to provide the secret numbers that allow access to the account. This means since the secret access numbers (private key) are never provided, the purchaser is not vulnerable to having their money stolen when making a purchase.</div><h3 style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 30px; letter-spacing: -0.5px; line-height: 1.5em; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Low Transaction Fees</h3><div style="color: #363636; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 24px;">Credit card companies take a cut greater than 1% from EVERY SINGLE TRANSACTION you make. Think about that for a second. Every time you swipe your card, your credit card company gets to keep a percentage of your transaction. You don't think about it because stores don't show the percentage that goes to the credit card companies in the price, but you are definitely paying it. That is money the retailer does not get, and so they must inflate their prices to cover it. Bitcoin transactions in comparison can be low or even zero in many cases. The current recommended transaction fee is 0 for most large amount transactions and otherwise usually just .0001 BTC which is equivalent to about 6 cents US at the time of writing this. This means Bitcoin is very favorable for businesses since more money goes in their pocket instead of the pocket of the credit card company.</div><h3 style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 30px; letter-spacing: -0.5px; line-height: 1.5em; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Completely Peer to Peer with no Central Authority</h3><div style="color: #363636; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 24px;">In the government controlled banking world we've been living in, it's very hard to imagine what this means. It means nobody is controlling Bitcoin. When you send money with Bitcoin there is no intermediary. It's not like a bank. Think of it like digital cash meaning if you want to give someone $5, you walk up to them and hand them a $5 bill.</div><h3 style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 30px; letter-spacing: -0.5px; line-height: 1.5em; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">No Charge Backs</h3><div style="color: #363636; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 24px;">On one hand chargebacks are great. They allow us to get money back when we do not get the product or service we paid for.&nbsp;On the other hand, anyone who uses Paypal to sell items knows how often people use chargebacks to scam you out of money that is rightfully yours. Paypal decides, often seemingly arbitrarily, whether or not a chargeback is accepted. The same happens with credit cards. With Bitcoin there is no way to chargeback a transaction. If there was a way to chargeback, then Bitcoin would be worthless.</div><h3 style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 30px; letter-spacing: -0.5px; line-height: 1.5em; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Capped Supply</h3>
